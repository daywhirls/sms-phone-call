This program allows me to send a SMS message to my Twilio phone number in the format:
[phoneNumber messageWord1, messageWord2, ...]
example: "+1xxxxxxxxxx I know what you did last summer."

The program will parse the SMS message, call the specified phone number, and speak whatever message you gave it.
