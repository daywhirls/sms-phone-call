### (Text-to-Speech Outbound Calling Program)
#### This program allows me to send a SMS message to my Twilio phone number in the format:

    [phoneNumber messageWord1 messageWord2 ...]



>  example: "+1xxxxxxxxxx I know what you did last summer."

#### The program will parse the SMS message, call the specified phone number, and speak whatever message you gave it when the user answers the phone.
